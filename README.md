# Mail-Classifier
 Classifying emails as spam or ham (non-spam) using a Naïve Bayes approach  and Scikit-Learn’s `CountVectorizer`.
Beginning by analyzing three datasets, easy ham, hard ham, and spam.
After performing a proper train-test split, the data is preprocessed using a bag-of-words model. 
Two Naïve Bayes classifiers (Multinomial and Bernoulli) are evaluated.
For each classifier and dataset, accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices are provided.
